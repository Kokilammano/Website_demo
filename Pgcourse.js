                <p>
                The CAD/CAM Engineers are involved in creating the future. They are the driving force behind many of our technologies and industrial processes including innovative products like mobiles, PCs and DVDs etc in our modern world. The work of a CAD/CAM Engineer can be extremely challenging and fulfilling, requiring IT, design and analytical skills together with an ability to work as a team. As their work involves production, transmission and use of mechanical power and heat, they have to analyse the different materials used for the machines and their tolerances, investigate the different energy sources and the power they generate and the design problems.

                <h2>M.E Structural Engineering</h2>
                <p>
                Structural Engineering is a sub-discipline of Civil Engineering in which structural engineers are trained to design the form and shape of man-made structures. Structural engineering helps to understand the technical, economic, environmental and aesthetic aspects of structures & calculate the stability, strength and rigidity of structures.

                <p>
                The focus in this VLSI Design study programme is on understanding electronic networks and devices, electromagnetic field theory, computer fundamentals,their protection, and communication and control systems. Electronics engineers are also absorbed into the entertainment transmission industry, research establishments, and defence. They can also take up teaching and research in one of the many engineering colleges in India or abroad.
